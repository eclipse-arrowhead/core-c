# Eclipse Arrowhead C libraries

Each subfolder of this directory represents a C library of relevance to
developing and deploying Arrowhead systems. Currently, these libraries are
only meant to support the development of official Eclipse Arrowhead Core
systems. The libraries may become supported for wider use in the future.
