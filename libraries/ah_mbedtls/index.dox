/**

@dir ah_mbedtls/include

MbedTLS library include folder.

Add the path to this folder to your C compiler's include path when you use this
library.

@dir ah_mbedtls/include/ah

Arrowhead header folder.

As a matter of organization, all official Arrowhead libraries keep their headers
in a folder named @c ah directly inside an @c include folder. This makes it
possible to include any of its headers using a C statement such as
<code>\#include <ah/mbedtls.h></code>.
