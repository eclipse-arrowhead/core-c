/**
 * @file
 * JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) utilities.
 *
 * As a data interchange format, JSON is mainly dealt with directly in two
 * cases: (1) when constructing JSON representations and (2) when interpreting
 * JSON representations. Here, we primarily provide utilities for interpreting
 * JSON. That being said, we do describe how to accomplish both construction and
 * interpretation using only this and the C99 standard library here.
 *
 * <h3>JSON Construction</h3>
 *
 * To construct JSON objects, you must produce code that take whatever data
 * structures or values you need to encode and writes them as JSON to a buffer.
 *
 * To help you, this library most significantly provides the
 * ah_json_str_escape() function, which takes an arbitrary C string produces a
 * copy with any characters that are not allowed to occur in a JSON string
 * replaced by their JSON escape sequences. The C99 standard library provides
 * the printf() family of functions, which are able to produce JSON-compliant
 * numbers from C variables. However, the current locale, configurable via the
 * C99 setlocale() function, must use the dot character (<code>.</code>) as
 * <em>radix character</em>, or numbers with fractions will be represented
 * incorrectly. The default C locale does use this radix character, which means
 * that you only need to consider it if you ever change the locale.
 *
 * An example of a JSON representation being constructed is available at
 * @ref ah_json/examples/construct_object.c.
 *
 * <h3>JSON Interpretation</h3>
 *
 * Just as in the case of constructing JSON values, interpreting them requires
 * you to provide code for each value you want to handle. A major difference,
 * however, is that this library helps you with this interpretation by dividing
 * up the JSON data into <em>value tokens</em>, each represented by an instance
 * of ah_json_val. This division into tokens, or @e tokenization, is
 * accomplished using the ah_json_parse() function. While the parsing function
 * does guarantee that a successfully parsed JSON text is ECMA-404 conformant,
 * it does not automatically escape JSON escape sequences in the string tokens
 * in the output, if any. To help with this, we provide functions for escaping
 * and comparing JSON strings, ah_json_str_unescape() and ah_json_str_compare().
 * Another limitation of this library is that it does not automatically parse
 * JSON numbers. You may do that with C99 standard library functions, such as
 * strtoul() and strtod(). When using strtod() and strtof(), the same caveat
 * applies regarding the locale radix character having to be the dot character
 * as when constructing JSON using the printf() family of function.
 *
 * An example of a JSON representation being interpreted is available at
 * @ref ah_json/examples/interpret_object.c.
 *
